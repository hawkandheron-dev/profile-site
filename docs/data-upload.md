# Uploading CSV data for updates

You can provide CSV data in any of these ways:

1. **Paste the CSV contents directly in chat.**
   - I can save it into the repo (for example, `docs/works.csv` or another path you prefer).
2. **Provide a direct raw-download URL.**
   - If you host the CSV somewhere with a direct download link, I can pull it into the repo.
3. **Tell me the target path and the CSV content.**
   - I can create the file at that path in the repo and wire it into the codebase.

Let me know which option you prefer and the desired filename/path.
